This is Personal Project Called NextSnake

## What is NextSnake?

NextSnake is a Snake Game that is made with ReactJS and NextJS, which brings the classic game memories from past but with a modern touch.
I currentyl inspired by Vercel/NextJs theme of their website so i decided to make a game with that theme.

### Total Expected length of this project (all 5 versions)

- approx. of 7 months
- each version will take approx. 1.5 months to complete
- each version dates will be announced once I get a good team to join me in this project.

## How to Play?

NextSnake game web-based game, so you can play it in your browser. You can play it by visiting this link: (https://nextsnake.vercel.app/)
NextSnake game is mainly played using Arrow Keys, but you can also use WASD keys to play the game.
Currently I have still designed or taught to the game in mobile enviorment so it is not playable in mobile devices at current time.
